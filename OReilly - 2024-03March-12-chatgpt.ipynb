    "Even though we might think of programming as a solo activity, it's often better when you do it with other people. When you have to talk about something, you have to crystallize your thinking on the subject. That means you're forced to think more deeply, and come to clearer conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people have learned this over the years with programming: If they work with someone else (two people on one computer), then they're talking about what they're doing, and they have to think more before jumping in. That leads to better code that's often more readable, less buggy, more efficient than what they could do on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are companies where people always pair program. That might be extreme, but they claim it's great.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've certainly found pairing to be good (for me and for the other person). \n",
    "\n",
    "What if you're working on your own? What if your colleagues don't want to pair with you? What if you don't want to bug them for every little thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT can be really useful. It's always willing to listen and to give advice and feedback. Also, ChatGPT knows Python (and many other languages) very well!\n",

    "# What is ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is a very famous LLM. Machine learning works by extrapolating from examples. If you give a machine-learning model a bunch of inputs, it'll see the patterns from those inputs, and can then categorize new inputs that you might give it.  The more varied the inputs you give a ML model, the better the predictive capabilities and the more useful it can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to LLMs, the inputs are lots of text. When you ask it to generate new output, it starts with a word that it thinks is relevant to the answer. It then looks at all of the words that might come after that word, and uses statistical analysis to decide what comes next. Really, it's building an answer one word at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every single time you ask a LLM to generate text (or an image, for that matter), it'll give you something different. That's because it's using statistics to figure out what is the most likely next thing that you're expecting -- that's based on its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we can use ChatGPT to do many different programming-related tasks:\n",
