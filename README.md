# Data from my "Pair Programming with ChatGPT" course

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook + program files from my training for O'Reilly in March 2024.  It'll remain open, so you can review the material later on.

The ChatGPT output is here: https://chat.openai.com/share/a319ef7a-ae45-4d62-a96b-ddf6d8269e5e
